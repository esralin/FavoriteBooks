# FavoriteBooks
I created a project named “FavoriteBooks” (with GUI) developed with Java programming language which keeps a list of the books that a user has read and liked. This project holds data from the text document to integrate to some functions. These functions have tasks such as adding a book, deleting a book, searching etc. Users should enter values to use functionalities. After entering values, the user can see the results from the screen which I have designed.
